\subsection{Evaluating Aggregation Alternatives}
\label{subsec:res-agg}


\newtext{
To compare evaluating aggregations, this section first uses the cumulative probability of efficiency improvement in Section \ref{subsubsec:agg-sw} and efficiency achievement in Section \ref{subsubsec:agg-oop} for MAAR DSE with different aggregations to show their fairness. Then, Exploration time is compared in Section \ref{subsubsec:agg-time} to analyze their scalability.
