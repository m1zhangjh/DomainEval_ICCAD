\figref{fig:allsw} shows the average efficiency improvement ($rEEF_{SW}$) across all applications of different DSE platforms over increasing ACCs budgets. OOP yields the absolute upper bound for a given HW constraints. OOP plateaus after ACCs=9, since each application only has up to 10 unique kernels. Since SW compared with itself, the $rEFF_{SW}$ value of SW is always equal to 1, which yields the lower bound. \newtext{MAAR DSE uses $Alog$ (log area aggregation of $EEF$) evaluation. MARR-Alog's average efficiency improvement increases with the number of ACCs. It approaches the OOP efficiency when ACCs=19. On average across the HW ACC budgets, MAAR-Alog has 1.39 times the efficiency improvement of DSS, and 4.01 times the improvement of 1appDSE}.

\newtext{
To give a detail comparison among different DSEs, 
\figref{fig:sw12all} shows the cumulative probability of efficiency improvement for OOP, MAAR, DSS and 1AppDSE with a ACCs=12 budget.} 
The x-axis denotes efficiency improvement ($rEFF_{SW}$), and y-axis is the cumulative probability.
A point ($x$, $y$) indicates that a proportion $y$ of applications have a relative efficiency $x$ or less.  
E.g. there is 67.5\% (0.675 in y-axis) probability that OOP has 10x ($10^1$ in x-axis) or 10x less efficiency improvement. In another description, OOP has 32.5\% ($1-0.675$ in y-axis) to achieve 10x or 10x more efficiency improvement. 

In \figref{fig:sw12all}, the line positioned more toward the bottom right has a better efficiency improvement, and OOP black line is the upper bound. 
\newtext{
SW can be considered as lower bound, which has constant 1 efficiency improvement (i.e. vertical line $x = 10^0$ if drawn). 
As \figref{fig:sw12all} shown, MAAR-Alog (red line) improves efficiency more than 1appDSE (up left black line) and DSS (green line) for almost all applications. 
67.5\% ($1-0.325$ in y-axis) of applications have at least a 3x improvements, while 1appDSE and DSS only improve 15\% ($1-0.85$) and 42.5\% ($1-0.575$) of applications respectively by the same amount. 
Note that 1AppDSE has a more smooth line, and shows more detail as it considers running any application on any application's dedicated OPT platform.
