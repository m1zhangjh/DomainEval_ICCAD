\section{Unified Platform Allocation}
\label{sec:eval}

This section introduces Unified Platform Allocation (UPA) supporting many applications. \secref{subsec:MAAR} introduces a heuristic method, an elitist genetic algorithm, to efficiently traverse the large design space. To achieve fair evaluation for many applications, \secref{subsec:relativeEff} defines relative efficiency which balances across many vastly different applications, and \secref{subsec:aggregation} proposes and evaluates different methods to fairly aggregate efficiency across many applications to evaluate different platforms.
