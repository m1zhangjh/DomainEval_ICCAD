% Jinghan Abstract
%Domain-specific computing is a promising solution to bridge the flexibility/efficiency gap for a broader set of applications. Streaming applications within a domain, such as video analytics, software-defined radio, and radar, benefit from domain specialization due to functional and structural similarities. To aid their design, new evaluation methodologies and tools are needed with a broader scope of application set instead of individual applications.

%This paper introduces a novel domain-specific platform evaluation methodology for domain-specific computing with a focus on streaming applications. Key contributions are: (1) A methodology flow to evaluate the efficiency of platform for domain applications, (2) relative efficiency to have a fair view for all domain applications, (3) relative efficiency aggregation of domain applications to quantitatively judge domain platform and (4) using different fair evaluations to guide domain-specific design space exploration (DS-DSE).

%Using heterogeneous accelerator-rich (ACC-rich) platforms which combine processor cores with specialized HW accelerators (ACCs), is one main approach to high-performance low-power computing.
%ACCs can be shared across many applications, when they have functional and structural similarities, especially in streaming applications, such as video analytics, software-defined radio, and radar.
%However, many applications on the same platform are only considered as individual mapping problem to a fixed platform. Current Design Space Exploration (DSE) of platform allocation mostly focuses on single applications.
%To increase the scope of DSE of platform allocation to consider many applications, efficient traversal and fair evaluation of platforms across applications are needed.


Using heterogeneous accelerator-rich (ACC-rich) platforms which combine processor cores with specialized HW accelerators (ACCs), is one main approach to achieve high-performance and low-power especially for streaming applications, such as video analytics, software-defined radio, and radar. 
Here, a set of applications with functional and structural similarities could benefit from a common platform with the same set of ACCs. 
However, current Design Space Exploration (DSE) approaches mostly focuses on allocating one dedicated platform for one individual application. 
Automating the design of a common platform for a set of applications requires increasing the scope of DSE to consider many applications, efficient design space traversal and a fair evaluation across applications.


This paper introduces Many Applications ACC-Rich (MAAR) DSE with kernel granularity.
Key contributions in MAAR are:
(1) a genetic algorithm (GA) guided by \newtext{a fair and efficient evaluation} to allocate one platform for many applications, 
(2) a definition of relative efficiency to fairly compare the improvement of applications on a platform, 
and (3) evaluating aggregation of the performance of many applications to quantitatively compare the efficiency of platforms. 
This paper validates MAAR DSE by using it OpenVX applications. Compared to a single application DSE (1AppDSE) and previous domain DSE Dynamic Score Selection (DSS~\cite{zhang2018ds}), MAAR has a 4.01 and 1.39 times higher average efficiency improvement respectively. With a budget of 12 ACCs, MAAR enables more applications (67.5\% of applications) to achieve high efficiency (efficiency improvement $\geq$ 3) than 1AppDSE (15\%) and DSS(42.5\%).
