\subsection{Fair Aggregation across Many Apps}
\label{subsec:aggregation}

In order to quantitatively reason about platforms, the normalized application efficiencies need to be aggregated into a single fitness value. This section proposes and compares aggregation options.

Illustrating the aggregation challenge, \figref{fig:eff} shows normalized efficiencies of application on an example Unified Platform (UP, blue) normalized by the lower bound SW platform (orange) in \figref{fig:effSW} and by the upper bound ODP (grey) in \figref{fig:effOOP}. In \figref{fig:effSW}, the relative efficiency of SW is always equal to 1, because it is normalized by itself. The ODP has higher $rEFF_{SW}$ than the UP for each application because ODP is the optimal platform design for each application. \figref{fig:effOOP} shows relative efficiency compared with ODP $rEFF_{ODP}$ for SW, UP and ODP. Similarly, ODP always has a $rEFF_{ODP}$ of 1 because it is normalized by itself. UP has $rEFF_{ODP}$ between SW and ODP, because UP accelerates some kernels to achieve better performance than SW, and is not the application own optimal platform, so it performs worse than the ODP.
