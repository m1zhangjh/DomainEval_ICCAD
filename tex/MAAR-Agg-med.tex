\subsubsection{Median Aggregation}

Instead of focusing on the overall relative efficiency of all applications, maximizing the median efficiency across applications is another fitness function choice. 
Because median-maximizing behavior is more resilient to outliers, it is a good candidate to balance acceleration potential across many applications, and the median-maximizing guided DSE may provide a more balanced platform with a good efficiency distribution of applications. 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:med} shows two median maximizing fitness functions of two relative efficiencies $rEFF_{SW}$ and $rEFF_{OOP}$.

\begin{split}
	M\mhyphen SW (p_{X}) &= med(rEFF_{SW}(a_{i}, p_{X})),   i = 0,1,...,\#a \\
	M\mhyphen OOP (p_{X}) &= med(rEFF_{OOP}(a_{i}, p_{X})), i = 0,1,...,\#a
